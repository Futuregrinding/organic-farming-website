    <h2>🌱 Sustainable Agriculture: The Need of the Hour</h2>
    <p>
      Modern food systems are straining the planet. Sustainable agriculture — led by organic farming and
      humane animal husbandry — protects soil, conserves water, and supplies safer food while supporting
      local communities and biodiversity.

      <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
      <span>Cleaner environment • Healthier food • Resilient communities</span>

      <h2>🌾 Organic Farming — Working with Nature</h2>
      <p>
        Organic farming avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, relying on compost, crop rotation,
        and natural pest control to regenerate soil and nurture ecosystems.

      <h2>🐄 Animal Husbandry — Care, Welfare, Balance</h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable animal husbandry emphasizes animal welfare, responsible breeding, and waste recycling
        (manure becomes valuable compost), cutting emissions and improving farm productivity.
      </p>

      <div class="benefits">
        <div class="benefit"><strong>Environmental:</strong> Better waste management, lower pollution, supports circular farming.</div>
        <div class="benefit"><strong>Health:</strong> Safer dairy and meat from healthy, well-cared-for animals.</div>

    <h2>🌍 Towards a Greener, Healthier Tomorrow</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing organic methods and humane animal care reduces environmental damage and yields food that is better
      for people and the planet. Small decisions — at farms, shops, and kitchens — scale into big, positive change.
